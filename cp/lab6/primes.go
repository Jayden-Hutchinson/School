// Write a Go program to find the size of the largets set of 6-digit primes
// that are permutations of one another.
//
// Return a slice containing all prmes p satisfying m <= p < n.
// The implementation must be based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
// For testing purposes, your program must print out the size of the set of
// all 6-digit primes as well as the size of the largest set of 6-digit
// primes that are permutations of one another.
// Do not print out eh set of all 6-digit primes - you only need to print
// its size.

// precondition: 0 <= m < n
