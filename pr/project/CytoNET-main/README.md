# Kinector

<b>Company/Business Profile</b>

Kinexus Bioinformatics studies protein communication systems in living cells for the diagnosis of diseases and identification of drug targets and drugs for therapeutic intervention. These regulatory networks operate like molecular intelligence systems inside of cells to control all of their operations. The Company’s efforts are focused on the development of proteomics methods to track over 800 cell signalling proteins in specimens prepared from cells and tissues. In parallel, it is expanding its on-line SigNET websites to permit meta-analyses of the data generated from the application of its discovery platform. The Company's core technologies include the production and testing of over 1300 antibodies to probe the expression and modifications (such as phosphorylation) of signalling proteins, and development of the world's highest content antibody microarrays to permit over 5000 individual tests on a single microscope slide. The Company’s bioinformatics efforts seek to advance precision medicine treatment of human diseases by linking human gene sequence, protein interaction and drug interaction information.

<b>Project Description</b>

The proposed graphic mapping project called Kinector aims to develop an open-access website interface for generating small maps that define possible links between protein kinases and their targets to support biomedical research.

Kinases are the largest group of cell signalling proteins, and they are enzymes that switch other proteins on or off by catalyzing their direct phosphorylation. The human genome encodes over 568 protein kinases that regulate each other and at least 20,000 other proteins. Kinexus has built a database that documents over 20,000 connections between kinases and their targets. With this project, we seek to: 1) produce a graphical interface whereby users can specify a “starting” protein and an “ending” protein (represented at icons), and routes by which these proteins are connected (represented as edges) with as many as 4 intervening proteins that can be shown; 2) to hyperlink the icons representing the proteins to information available about them on other SigNET websites produced by Kinexus or hosted by other academic organizations; and 3) to hyperlink the icons to antibodies and other tools produced by Kinexus that can track these proteins and the sites at which they are phosphorylated.

The proposed project builds on a suite of on-line, open-access SigNET KnowledgeBases that have been constructed and launched over the last decade. We would like the new Kinector website to have a similar look to our existing websites (e.g., www.phosphonet.ca, www.kinasenet.ca, www.drugpronet.ca). Presently, we have one website that graphically shows direct protein-protein and protein-drug connections called KinAtlas (http://kinatlas.ca:8080/KinAtlas/ProteinProteinQuery.html). A KinAtlas query can be performed with the common name or Uniprot ID number of any human protein (e.g. MAPK1, P28482, and selecting a tissue like brain).

<b>The latest update expands Kinector's mapping capabilities to include:</b>

- Interactive visualization of extracellular small molecule and protein interactions with cellular receptors

- Comprehensive mapping of cellular receptor interactions, showing both extracellular connections and downstream cellular protein relationships

- Detailed protein-receptor interaction networks within cells

- Visualization of post-translational modifications for extracellular proteins and receptors

- Anatomical mapping system showing source locations of extracellular mediators and their receptors across human organs, cells, and tissues

These new features enhance Kinector's ability to visualize complex molecular relationships while maintaining integration with existing protein and drug interaction data.
