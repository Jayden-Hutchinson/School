            <p class="text-[#cdcdcd]">KiNECTOR is an open-access, knowledgebase developed by Kinexus Bioinformatics
                Corporation to track the
                linkages of extracellular mediators to kinase-based cell signalling pathways in human cells. The CytoNET
                module of KiNECTOR documents human cell receptor interactions (RIs) directly with extracellular
                mediators
                and intracellular proteins. The KiNET module of KiNECTOR further tracks over 24,000 human
                kinase-substrate
                relationships (KSRs). All of these interactions are displayed in a unique graphic format, that permits
                retrieval of key information and serves as a portal to other reputable websites that also contain
                additional
                detailed information on these signalling proteins or small molecule mediators. These maps also provide
                direct
                links to antibody products available from Kinexus that facilitate further studies of these regulatory
                proteins and
                aid in interpretation of the findings from the antibody microarray services provided by Kinexus.
                Over 80% of the 21,300 proteins encoded by the human genome appear to be subject to phosphorylation that
                may be altered in response to over 600 extracellular mediators that include small molecules and proteins
                such as
                hormones and cytokines. While at least 250,000 and possibly a million phosphosites exist in the human
                phosphoproteome,
                only a small fraction of these are likely to be consequential. Future studies are needed to define the
                most important
                RIs and KSRs for a comprehensive understanding of the most critical regulatory networks that govern
                cellular communications
                and control. The information provided on KiNECTOR were retrieved from several sources, including
                UniProt, STRING,
                PhosphoNET, and PhosphoSitePlus, and other websites and the scientific literature. The protein-protein
                interactions
                displayed on KiNECTOR correspond to only those that have been experimentally verified in multiple
                studies. Consequently,
                not all known or possible protein-protein interactions are shown.

            <h2 class="text-[#FFC721] font-bold mb-4">Instructions...</h2>
            <p class="text-[#cdcdcd]">KiNECTOR is designed to be intuitive and simple to navigate. You can use the
                UniProt ID or common short
                names for the signalling proteins of interest in order to find direct receptor interactions and
                kinase
                interactions. Lists of possible options for proteins are generated by typing at least three letters of
                their names or identification numbers, and waiting for a few moments for a complete list of options
                to
                appear. Follow the steps outlined on the query webpages when searching for connections. Eight
                possible
                types of queries are available in the KiNECTOR atlas. These include: 1) Extracellular mediator-based
                interaction query; 2) Receptor-based interaction query; 3) Intracellular protein-based receptor
                interaction query; 4) Extracellular mediators and receptors tissue and cell distribution query; 5)
                Covalent modifications of extracellular mediator proteins and receptors query; 6) Kinase-based
                phosphoprotein substrate query; 7) Phosphoprotein substrate-based kinase query; and 8) Kinase direct
                and
                indirect phosphoprotein target query.
                Except for the last type of query, only direct interactions are visualized on the maps. However, it
                is
                feasible to easily identify further protein interactions from these maps. Clicking on an interacting
                protein icon (node) connected with a line or arrow (edge) will generate a new map of direct protein
                interactions with this protein as the central hub. For some queries, the number of interactions may
                be
                too large and clear visual representation is not possible on a single map. By activating the
                available
                filters, simpler maps can be generated. Extra map pages can be shown by clicking "Previous" or
                "Next"
                buttons. Hovering the cursor above the icons (nodes) for proteins or post-translation modification
                sites
                generates a pop-up that provides functional information and links to websites with further
                information
                and available antibody products from Kinexus. The Kinase direct and indirect phosphoprotein target
                query
                permits the user to find direct and indirect connections between a starting protein kinase of
                interest
                and a phosphorylated target protein. For this query, clicking on the line (edge) will reveal the
                specific phosphosites that are modified by the upstream kinase on the target phosphoprotein.
